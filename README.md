# Picture-Admin :camera:

The idea is to have a database of picture storage. An admin could view,upload and edit the pictures and users. 

## Getting Started

In a 4 days span I am building a full stack app that would do the crud function both showing the pictures and user. Also you can analyze the data on how many pictures was upload and viewed.
